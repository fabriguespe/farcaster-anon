## Usage

```bash
yarn add @xmtp/botkit

```tsx
import { run, HandlerContext } from "@xmtp/botkit";

run(async (context: HandlerContext) => {
  // Get the message and the address from the sender
  const { content, senderAddress } = context.message;

  // To reply, just call `reply` on the HandlerContext.
  await context.reply(`gm`);
});
```

Here‚Äôs how to easily deploy this bot:

- Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app/).
- Click 'New Project' and select 'Node.js'.
- Create a Rredis DB or other (Optional)
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Set your environment variables
- Deploy your application.
- Register an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/) and share your bot!

## Development

To kickstart the tutorial, you'll need to clone the repository containing the bot code. Follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xmtp/botkit
cd botkit
# copy env variables template
cp .env.example .env
```

**Set the variables**

```bash
KEY= # the private key of the bot
XMTP_ENV= # set to production or dev network
```

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# running the bot
yarn build
yarn start

# to run with hot-reload
yarn build:watch
yarn start:watch

# run the gm example

yarn start:gm
```
